Both back-end and front-end unit testing will be done using the chai-mocha framework. Mocha is a javascript        
framework for Node.js which allows Asynchronous testing. Chai is an assertion library helpful for RESTful API testing. For the testing process, the back end team will write a basic test that will fail when making a new feature. Then Tenzin will write more extensive tests for those features while the back-end team continues to refactor the code.

The same approach will be taken for client-side testing as well. Both approaches will require extensive communication with both the front and back-end teams and for the tester to be familiar with both frontend and backend implementations.  

For Travis CI, we will make sure to have good test coverage. We will make sure to cover 100% of all the functionality we want to provide. This will be done by writing extensive unit tests for any functions that are testable.
