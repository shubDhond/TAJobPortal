### **API.md: API design and swagger definitions**

Our system consists of three service which are responsible for authentication, persistence and management of their corresponding objects. The users service is reponsible for sign up and authentication of student and ta coordinator accounts. The applications service is responsible for all student applications opperations. Lastly the TA coordinators service is reponsible for all postings, courses, and assignments opperations.
